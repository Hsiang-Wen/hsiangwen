# Hi, I'm Hsiang-Wen (翔雯) 🌙🎭  
**Sound Designer · Singer · Storyteller**

I create immersive sonic experiences that blend emotion, storytelling, and technical craft—especially for theatre, music, and narrative performance.
With a B.A. in Drama from National Taiwan University and a deep love for music and voice,  
I'm passionate about creating sonic narratives that resonate with feeling and humanity.

## 🧡 What Drives Me

I'm moved by sonic intimacy, the poetics of voice, and the textures of memory.  
My work often revolves around emotionality, obsession, and the act of reclaiming one's voice.

Whether through a whisper in headphones, a thunderous theatrical cue,  
or a song sung on a quiet night — I want my sound to *feel*.
